# machine learning
Repository containing all the machine learning models and project completed by me for academic and self learningy purposes. Presented in the form of iPython Notebooks.

     _Tools : scikit-learn, numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib_

## Machine_learning_models:
-  [Linear_Regression](https://github.com/karishma2361998/machine-learning/blob/1e98c14917ce8db5f9bbe4211080229b35fe8b5b/machine%20learning%20models/Linear_Regression.ipynb): In this model the company is trying to decide whether to focus their efforts on their mobile app experience or their website.

-  [Logistic_Regression](https://github.com/karishma2361998/machine-learning/blob/1e98c14917ce8db5f9bbe4211080229b35fe8b5b/machine%20learning%20models/Logistic_Regression.ipynb): Here we are working with the fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement.

-  [Support_Vector_Machines](https://github.com/karishma2361998/machine-learning/blob/1e98c14917ce8db5f9bbe4211080229b35fe8b5b/machine%20learning%20models/Support%20Vector%20Machines.ipynb): In this model we are using iris flower data set to predict the species of Iris flower by their features.

## Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction_project:
Wine is an alcoholic beverage made from fermented grapes. Yeast consumes the sugar in the grapes and converts it to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and heat. It is a pleasant tasting alcoholic beverage, loved cellebrated . It will definitely be interesting to analyze the physicochemical attributes of wine and understand their relationships and significance with wine quality and types classifications. To do this, We will proceed according to the standard Machine Learning  like random forest classifer. and created a case study which is present in 'notebook.ipynb' file.

Then deploy the app for wine prediction in streamlit.This app predict the wine quality of each wine sample, which may be good , bad, average.

- ## Following are the steps for building model:
  1. data overview

  2. EDA

  3. data visualization

  4. model building

  5. hyperparameter tunning

  6. voting classifier
